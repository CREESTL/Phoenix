### Run the Bot

<a name="preqs">

#### Prerequisites

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Clone this repository with `git clone https://git.sfxdx.ru/phoenix/autobot`
- Navigate to the directory with the cloned code
- Install Harhdat with `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
- Install all required dependencies with `npm install`
- Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project with the same contents as `.env.example`
- Copy your wallet's private key (see [Wallets](#wallets)) to `.env` file
  ```
  ACC_PRIVATE_KEY=***your private key***
  ```
- Input a swap threshold (see [Bot Logic](#logic)) to the `.env` file
  ```
  SWAP_THRESHOLD=***swap threshold***
  ```
- Input a swap amount (see [Bot Logic](#logic)) to the `.env` file
  ```
  AMOUNT=***amount***
  ```
- Input a maximum price change (in %) (see [Bot Logic](#logic)) to the `.env` file
  ```
  MAX_PRICE_CHANGE=***maximum price change***
  ```
- Input a gas price multiplier (see [Bot Logic](#logic)) to the `.env` file

  ```
  GAS_MULTIPLIER=***gas price multiplier***
  ```

  :warning:**DO NOT SHARE YOUR .env FILE IN ANY WAY OR YOU RISK TO LOSE ALL YOUR FUNDS**:warning:

#### Run

```
npx hardhat run app/main.js --network <network_name>
```

#### Networks

а) **Ultron test** network  
Make sure you have _enough test tokens_ for testnet.

```
npx hardhat run app/main.js --network ultronTestnet
```

a) **Ultron main** main network  
Make sure you have _enough real tokens_ in your wallet. Deployment to the mainnet costs money!

```
npx hardhat run app/main.js --network ultronMainnet
```

<a name="wallets"/>

### Wallets

For deployment you will need to use either _your existing wallet_ or _a generated one_.

#### Using an existing wallet

If you choose to use your existing wallet, then you will need to be able to export (copy/paste) its private key. For example, you can export private key from your MetaMask wallet.  
Wallet's address and private key should be pasted into the `.env` file (see [Prerequisites](#preqs)).

#### Creating a new wallet

If you choose to create a fresh wallet for this project, you should use `createWallet` script from `scripts/` directory.

```
npx hardhat run scripts/createWallet.js
```

This will generate a single new wallet and show its address and private key. **Save** them somewhere else!  
A new wallet _does not_ hold any tokens. You have to provide it with tokens of your choice.  
Wallet's address and private key should be pasted into the `.env` file (see [Prerequisites](#preqs)).

### Bot Logic

#### Terms

- `Swap threshold` - the ratio of tokens' prices enough to initialize the swap. (e.g. set swap threshold to `1.5` if you want the swap to happen when USDC is 1.5 times more expensive than USDT of vice versa)
  - If no value is provided, the default value of `1.5` is used
- `Swap amount` - the amount of tokens (USDT or USDC depending on the tokens' prices ratio) to swap
  - If swap amount is 0 then _all user's tokens will be swapped_. So between the swaps a user will have his whole balance consisting of either USDT or USDC (**only** if user's balance is less than the _optimal amount_)
  - If swap amount is _not_ 0 then exactly the provided amount of tokens will be swapped
  - Swap amount _can not_ be a negative integer
- `Max price change` - how much can a price of deposited token change after the deposit (_in percents_)
  - If the expected price of the token changes for more than [max price change %], the swap would be cancelled
  - Max price change _should_ be a positive integer
  - If no value is provided, the default value of `1%` is used
- `Gas price multiplier` - how many times to increase the default gas price
  - The higher the multiplier, the higher the gas price of the transaction, the faster the transaction gets mined and included into the block
  - Multiplier _should_ be a positive integer
  - If no value is provided, the default value of `2` is used

#### Logic Flow

**Scenario №1 (Normal):**

- Swap threshold = 1.5; Swap amount = **4**; Max price change = 0.1
- Users initial balances:
  - USDC: 100
  - USDT: 0
- Bot hears the "**Mint**" event in the pool. That means that someone has provided liquidity into the pool, changing tokens' prices
- Bot compares USDC and USDT prices
  - **USDC** turns out to have a higher price
- Bot checks that USDC price is at least 1.5 \* USDT price
  - The result is positive. Price difference is not 1.5 but even 2
- Bot checks if swapping 4 USDC to 4 \* 2 = 8 USDT will change USDC price for more than 0.1%
  - The result is negative (price will not change that much)
- Bot swaps **4** USDC for 8 USDT
- User's balances:
  - USDC: 96
  - USDT: 8
- Bot hears the "**Mint**" event in the pool once again.
- Bot compares USDC and USDT prices
  - USDC turns out to have a higher price
- Bot **does not** swap USDC to USDT because now it _only makes sence to swap back: USDT to USDC_
- User's balances:
  - USDC: 96
  - USDT: 8
- Bot hears the "**Mint**" event in the pool once again.
- Bot compares USDC and USDT prices
  - **USDT** turns out to have a higher price
- Bot checks that USDT price is at least 1.5 \* USDC price
  - The result is positive. Price difference is not 1.5 but even 2
- Bot checks if swapping 4 USDT to 4 \* 2 = 8 USDC will change USDT price for more than 0.1%
  - The result is negative (price will not change that much)
- Bot swaps **4** USDT for 8 USDC
- User's balances:
  - USDC: 106
  - USDT: 4

and so on...

**Scenario №2 (No amount provided):**

- Swap threshold = 1.5; Swap amount = **0**; Max price change = 0.1
- User's initial balances:
  - USDC: 100
  - USDT: 0
- Bot hears the "**Mint**" event in the pool. That means that someone has provided liquidity into the pool, changing tokens' prices
- Bot compares USDC and USDT prices
  - **USDC** turns out to have a higher price
- Bot checks that USDC price is at least 1.5 \* USDT price
  - The result is positive. Price difference is not 1.5 but even 2
- Bot detects that the user **did not provide** any amount to swap
  - In that case bot uses _the whole user's balance_ as the swap amount.
- Bot checks if swapping **100** USDC to 100 \* 2 = 200 USDT will change USDC price for more than 0.1%
  - The result is positive (price **will** change that much)
- That means that the swap using 100 USDC gets cancelled
- Bot now **calculates the maximum amount** of USDC that after being deposited into the pool will not change USDC price for more than 0.1%
  - This amount is 26
  - This is a "greedy" algorithm
- Bot swaps **26** USDC for 26 \* 2 = 52 USDT
- User's balances:
  - USDC: 74
  - USDT: 52
- Bot hears the "**Mint**" event in the pool once again.
- Bot compares USDC and USDT prices
  - **USDC** turns out to have a higher price
- Bot **does not** swap USDC to USDT because now it _only makes sence to swap back: USDT to USDC_
- User's balances:
  - USDC: 74
  - USDT: 52
- Bot hears the "**Mint**" event in the pool once again
- Bot compares USDC and USDT prices
  - **USDT** turns out to have a higher price
- Bot checks that USDT price is at least 1.5 \* USDC price
  - The result is positive. Price difference is not 1.5 but even 2
- Bot detects that the user **did not provide** any amount to swap
  - In that case bot uses _the whole user's balance_ as the swap amount.
- Bot checks if swapping 52 USDT to 54 \* 2 = 108 USDC will change USDT price for more than 0.1%
  - The result is positive (price **will** change that much)
- That means that the swap using 54 USDT gets cancelled
- Bot now **calculates the maximum amount** of USDT that after being deposited into the pool will not change price for more than 0.1%
  - This amount is 14
- Bot swaps **14** USDT for 14 \* 2 = 28 USDC
- User's balances:
  - USDC: 102
  - USDT: 38

and so on...

---

In the Scenario №1 if the amount to swap was much higher (e.g. 5 000 000), that would mean that each swap would have been cancelled because swapping such a high amount of USDC would have changed USDC price dramatically. In that case **no optimal amount** gets calculated by the bot in that case. The user is suggested to either provide a lower amount, or to not provide any amount at all. The **optimal amount** gets calculated **only** if the user did not provide the amount himself.

In the Scenario №2 if after checking USDC price change after the deposit the result was negative (the price will not change that much) the bot would have used a whole user's balance for the swap and the following steps would have been the same as in the Scenario №1. No optimal amount of tokens would have been calculated.

In all above examples "**Mint**" event could be replaced with "**Swap**" or "**Burn**" events. The all token's price inside the pool.

In all above examples if the price difference of tokens was less than 1.5, the swap would have been cancelled.

### Scripts

One of the ways of testing is running both the `app/main.js` and `scripts/events.js` on the same network. The `events.js` script (as you can probably tell from the name of it) triggers the events that the `main.js` app should listen to inside the pool of USDT/USDC. The best way to run them together is:

- Run _forked_ Ultron Mainnet node locally:

```
npx hardhat node --network hardhat
```

- Run `main.js` app:

```
npx hardhat run app/main.js --network localhost
```

- Run `events.js` script:

```
npx hardhat run scripts/events.js --network localhost
```

After that you should see the bot reacting to events in the pool and making a swap from USDC to USDT.
